### **Features:**

* Solves a 9x9 Sudoku board using backtracking.
* Detects empty cells and fills them with numbers from 1 to 9.
* Ensures that numbers don't repeat in any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.
* Efficient and recursive solution for Sudoku puzzles.
* Displays the solved board in the console.
